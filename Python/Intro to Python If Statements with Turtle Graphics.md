# Intro

In our last video, we learned how to use for-loops to make our code simpler by avoiding repetition. We even drew a cool spiral with our turtle Keith. Today, we're going to learn how our code could help our code make decisions in Python: the `if` statement.

An `if` statement allows our code to do something only if a certain condition is met. It's like making a decision based on a question. For example, if it's raining, you take an umbrella. If it's not raining, you don't.  

Just like how we decide what to wear based on the weather, our code can decide what to do based on different conditions. Let's dive in and see how this works!

# Outro

Today we learned how to use an `if` statements to make our code flexible. We also saw how to use an `if` statements to draw a flower.

Can you think of other ways to use `if` statements to make your code more interesting? I'm curious to know what you come up with! Post your ideas in the comments!

This video is the forth in a series that gently introduces people to programming with Python and the turtle graphics library.
